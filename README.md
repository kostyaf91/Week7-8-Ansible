# Ansible for Azure DevOps project
### This project is part of the DevOps Bootcamp by Sela.

**I'm using this playbook as part of the Azure DevOps release pipeline**
### The playbook will:
1. Update nodejs package
2. Install Node.js
3. Copy the artifact
4. Copy .env that created in the pipeline
5. Run dev and initdb
6. Install pm2 and initialize it



*This Project isn't my best, I'm still need to implement it better*
